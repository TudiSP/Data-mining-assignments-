Task 1 questions:
1.Purpose of adding Gaussian noise:
Adding Gaussian noise to the output variable ( Y ) simulates real-world data,
which often contains some level of randomness or measurement error.
This helps in evaluating the robustness and performance of regression models
under realistic conditions.
2.Importance of visualizing the data and the true functions:
Visualizing the data and the true functions allows you to:
Understand the underlying relationship between the variables.
Assess how well the model fits the data.
Identify any patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data.
Evaluate the impact of noise on the data and the model's predictions.
This visualization is crucial for diagnosing issues related to model
bias and variance, and for making informed decisions about model selection and tuning.

Task 2 questions:

1. What is a polynomial regression model and how is it different from a linear regression model?
A polynomial regression model is a type of regression analysis where the relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y) is modeled as an (n)th degree polynomial
What do you expect to happen with the bias and variance of polynomial regression models when the polynomial degree increases?
Task 3 questions:

1.Is it necessary to train multiple models to estimate the bias, variance, and irreducible error?
Yes, it is necessary to train multiple models to estimate the bias, variance,
and irreducible error. This is because bias and variance are statistical
properties that require multiple samples to estimate. Training multiple models
on different subsets of the data allows you to observe how the model's predictions vary,
which is essential for calculating these metrics.
3.Is it possible to estimate the model’s variance without access to the true regression function?
Yes, it is possible to estimate the model’s variance without access to the true regression
function. Variance measures how much the model's predictions vary for different
training sets. By training multiple models on different subsets of the data and observing
the variability in their predictions, you can estimate the model's variance.
